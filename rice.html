    <div style="padding:30px;">
    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Variety Selection:</h2>
    <ul><li><h3>Rice Varieties:</h3> There are four main types of rice: <ul><li> Indica </li>
    <li>Japonica</li><li>aromatic</li><li>glutinous</li></ul> </li></ul>
    <p>In general, the rice family can be broken down into three main categories:</p>
    <ul><li><h3>Long Grain:</h3>Approx. 6-8 mm long, about 3-4 times longer than thick. The endosperm is hard and vitreous. The best long grain varieties come from Thailand, Southern US, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam.</li>
    <li><h3>Medium Grain:</h3>Approx. 5-6 mm long, but thicker than long grain rice. The endosperm is soft and chalky. It releases about 15% starch into water during cooking. Medium grain rice is mainly grown in China, Egypt and Italy.</li>
<li><h3>Short Grain or Round Grain:</h3>Approx. 4-5 mm long, only 1.5-2 times longer than thick. The endosperm is soft and chalky. This variety is grown in subtropical areas like California, Egypt, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain and Portugal.</li></ul>
    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Regional Suitability:</h2>
    <h3>Climate:</h3>
    <ul><li><h3>Temperature:</h3> Rice requires a warm climate for optimal growth. It is generally sensitive to cold temperatures, so regions with a frost-free growing season are preferable.</li> 
    <li><h3>Rainfall:</h3>Adequate and well-distributed rainfall or access to irrigation water is essential for rice cultivation. Regions with a consistent water supply are more suitable.</li> </ul>
    <h3>Soil Type:</h3>
    <ul><li><h3>Soil Composition:</h3>Rice thrives in well-drained, loamy or clayey soils with good water-holding capacity. The pH level of the soil is also important; it should be slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6-7).</li>
    <li><h3>Soil Depth:</h3>Deep soils are preferred for rice cultivation as they allow for robust root development.</li></ul>
    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Growth stages</h2>
    <div class="image"><img style="padding:30px;" src="https://www.haifa-group.com/files/Guides/Rice/figure1.14.png"><img style="width:600px;" src="https://www.haifa-group.com/files/Guides/Rice/figure1.14a.png"></div>
    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Irrigation</h2>
    <p>Rice can grow in either a wet (paddy) or a dry (field) setting. (Rice fields are also called paddy fields or rice paddies).</p>
    <p>About 75% of the global rice production comes from irrigated rice systems because most rice varieties express their full yield potential when water supply is adequate.</p>
    <p>In cooler areas, during late spring, water serves also as a heat-holding medium and creates a much milder environment for rice growing.</p>
    <p>A pond could hold irrigation water to use in the summer, when demand for water is the greatest.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the rice in Asia is grown during the wet season starting in June-July, and dependence on rainfall is the most limiting production constraint for rain-fed culture. Rice areas in South and Southeast Asia may, in general, be classified into irrigated, rain-fed upland, rain-fed shallow water lowland and rain-fed deep water lowland areas.</p>
    <p>The productivity of well-managed, irrigated rice is highest, being in the range of 5-8 t/ha during the wet season and 7-10 t/ha during the dry season if very well managed, but the average is often only in the range of 3-5 t/ha. The productivity of rain-fed upland and deep water lowland rice, however, continues to be low and is static around 1.0 t/ha.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Yields</h2>
    <p>Yield gap is literally defined as the difference between yield potential of rice and yields that are actually obtained by farmers.</p>
    <p>Yield potential of traditional Indica varieties is about 5 t/ha, while yield potential of crossbreedingJaponica varieties x with high-yielding Indica varieties,is  about 10 t/ha Yield potential of high-yielding Japonica varieties is about 15 t/ha while the yield potential of hybrid varieties is about 18 t/ha.</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:25px;">Nutrient Management:</h2>
    <h3>Fertilizer Recommendations:</h3>    Provide information on the type, timing, and quantity of fertilizers required at different growth stages.
Nutrient Deficiency: Describe the symptoms of nutrient deficiencies and offer remedies.
Organic and Synthetic Fertilizers: Explain the pros and cons of both organic and synthetic fertilizers, helping farmers make sustainable choices.
